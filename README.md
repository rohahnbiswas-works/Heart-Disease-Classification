This ML classification model was created by me as a part of learning Machine Learning. This model utilizes several concepts of classification supervised learning and utilizes schikit-learn library. This model trains on a heart disease related dataset and does a binary prediction based on the features like age, sex, thalach etc.
Various Concepts like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation techniques of regression (like Accuracy,Recall,Precisionetc.) were learnt and utilized in this project.
